## Credits

StartTreeV2 is based on a static website generated using [StartTree](https://github.com/Paul-Houser/StartTree). Huge Thanks @Paul-Houser for creating such an awesome project!

How StartTreeV2 differs from StartTree:

The original version is a python program, which generates a static html page based on a yaml config.
This version is a website hosted on Github pages, which means you do not have to host it yourself. To configure your tree, I added a web editor, which allows editing the tree directly in the browser. That means you do not have to write a yaml config and recompile the page every time you want to make a change. Your configuration data is stored in the url, which you simply copy once you are done with your configuration.
